# What Do You Really Mean When You Say 'Simple'
An article 


The first thing I mean is simple to reason about. 

What I really mean is that its simple to me, I understand it already.


In software when we say simple we mean different things.

We usually tag things as simple if we already wrote it in code.


Actually simplicity in code do mean a lot of thing, simple to reason about is just one of them.

The problem is that simplifing one thing may cause in complexing another.

Simple to code in a short period.

Simple to test.

Simple to replace parts/resources

Simple to add/remove feature.

Simple to explain.


I think that the architect role is to decide which simpliciy come first.
